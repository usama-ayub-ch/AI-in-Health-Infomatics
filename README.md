# AI in Healthcare Projects Repository

Welcome to the AI in Healthcare Projects Repository! This repository contains several projects related to machine learning, deep learning, and AI in the healthcare domain. Each project comes with its proposal, description, and an accompanying Jupyter Notebook (ipynb file) containing the code implementation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning Classifiers
- **Proposal:**
- This project aims to predict breast cancer using various machine learning classifiers. It involves preprocessing     steps such as data cleaning, feature selection, and normalization.
- Then, different machine learning algorithms are applied including Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest Classifier to classify breast cancer based on input features.
- **Description:** The project explores different machine learning classifiers such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, etc., to predict breast cancer. It includes an in-depth analysis of the dataset, feature importance, and model evaluation metrics.

### 2. Heart Attack Prediction
- **Proposal:** The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using machine learning algorithms. It encompasses exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature selection, and model building. Additionally, it involves hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.
- **Description:** The project starts with data exploration and visualization to gain insights into the heart attack dataset. It then proceeds with preprocessing steps like handling missing values and feature engineering. Next, various machine learning models are trained, and k-fold cross-validation is utilized for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Finally, the performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and other relevant metrics.

## Project Structure
- Each project folder contains:
  - Proposal document (proposal.md or .pdf)
